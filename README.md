# Learning to Compare Financial Reports for Financial Forecasting

Please cite our paper if you use the code or data in your work:

## Introduction

This repository will contain the data and code used in the EACL 2024 paper. We will be adding them shortly. 

We source raw company filings (10Ks) from the Notre Dame Software Repository for Accounting and Finance (https://sraf.nd.edu/sec-edgar-data/). We apply extensive preprocessing to extract Section 7A: Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA). We use a variety of regular expressions to extract the MDA section and filter the resulting section text for quality in a refined iterative process. Please see Appendix A in our publication for further details on the data curation process.

We source stock price data from FactSet Prices \& Returns.

We thank FactSet and AJOVista for their permission to release this data to the academic community.
